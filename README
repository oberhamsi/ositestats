============

A website tracking server for RingoJs.

Install
----------
Requires ringo-sqlstore:

    ringo-admin install grob/ringo-sqlstore

Create `app/config.js` using `app/config-example.js` as a template:

    cp app/config-example.js app/config.js
    nano app/config.js

You will probably want to modify those properties:

    `store`: the mysql connection information
    `statsUpdateInterval`: interval for statistics update (minutes)
    `clickGraphUpdateInterval`: interval for clickgraph update (minutes)
    
The clickgraph shows the most often used paths through your website. It needs:

  * graphviz (specifically `/usr/bin/dot` must be present)
  * to create directories below `app/static/clickgraphs/`

Webinterface
--------------
The app gives you a dashboard to create new sites that need tracking:

  * Site name - keep to lowercase, alphanums for now
  * Domain - comma seperated list of TLDs that belong to that site

The list of domains is essential! Hits must originate from that domain or they are not counted.
