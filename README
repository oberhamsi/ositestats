============

A website tracking server for RingoJs.

Install
----------
Requires ringo-sqlstore and stick

    ringo-admin install grob/ringo-sqlstore
    ringo-admin install hns/stick

Create `config.js` using `config-example.js` as a template:

    cp config-example.js config.js
    nano config.js
    
The clickgraph shows the most often used paths through your website. It needs:

  * graphviz (specifically `/usr/bin/dot` must be present)
  * creates directories & files below `static/clickgraphs/`

Start with `ringo main.js`.

Webinterface
--------------
The app gives you a dashboard to create new sites that need tracking:

  * Site name - keep to lowercase, alphanums for now
  * Domain - comma seperated list of TLDs that belong to that site

The list of domains is essential! Hits must originate from that domain or they are not counted.
